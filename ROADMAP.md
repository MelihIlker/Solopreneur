# Solopreneur Roadmap

## Vision

Solopreneur is not another SaaS boilerplate. It's a **security-first, senior-level** client and project management platform built for solo entrepreneurs who refuse to compromise on architecture.

Every feature on this roadmap reflects our core principles:
- **Bulletproof over convenient**
- **Stateful over stateless** (when it matters)
- **Server control over client freedom**
- **Zero duct tape tolerance**

This is where we're going.

---

## üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable Product) ‚Äî Core Functionality

The foundation. These modules establish the architectural patterns all future features will follow.

### Authentication & User Management

- [x] **Bulletproof Auth Module** ‚úÖ
  - Stateful Redis sessions (full revocability)
  - Timing attack prevention
  - Multi-layer brute-force protection (IP + Device + Email)
  - Honeypot bot detection
  - `destroyAllUserSessions` capability

- [x] **User Module** ‚úÖ
  - Profile management
  - Password change with current password verification
  - Account deletion (with session cleanup)
  - Full CRUD with proper service layer

### Core Business Logic

- [ ] **Projects Module** üöß *Next Priority*
  - Create, read, update, archive projects
  - Project status workflows (Draft ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Archived)
  - Project-customer relationship
  - Time tracking foundation
  - Service-layer validation for business rules

- [ ] **Customers Module**
  - Full customer lifecycle management
  - Customer-project linking
  - Contact information management

  - PDF generation
  - Payment tracking

---

## üîê Critical Authentication Flows

These flows are security-critical and require the same rigor as the auth module itself.

- [ ] **Email Verification Flow**
  - Secure, single-use tokens stored in Redis with TTL
  - `POST /api/auth/register` generates token
  - `GET /api/auth/verify?token=...` validates and activates account
  - Token invalidation after use
  - Rate limiting on verification attempts

- [ ] **Password Reset Flow**
  - Secure token generation (cryptographically random)
  - Redis storage with 15-minute TTL
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` sends email
  - `POST /api/auth/reset-password` validates token and updates password
  - All active sessions destroyed on password reset
  - Brute-force protection on reset attempts

- [ ] **Email Change Flow**
  - Verify new email before updating
  - Current password required
  - Confirmation email to both old and new addresses
  - Session preservation during change

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Enhancements

The project is secure by design, but these additions raise the bar further.

- [ ] **Session Anomaly Detection**
  - Geolocation changes (suspicious country-hopping)
  - User-agent changes (device fingerprint mismatches)
  - Concurrent session limits
  - Alert users on suspicious activity

- [ ] **Audit Logging**
  - Track critical actions (login, password change, data export)
  - Immutable audit trail in dedicated table
  - User-facing "Recent Activity" dashboard
  - Admin audit log viewer

- [ ] **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
  - Backup codes generation
  - Required for high-value actions (account deletion, payment changes)

- [ ] **Advanced Rate Limiting**
  - Distributed rate limiting (Redis-backed)
  - Dynamic rate limit adjustment based on user reputation
  - Rate limit dashboard for admins

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Have ideas? Open an issue with the `roadmap` label. But remember: every feature must justify its existence and align with our security-first, senior-level principles.

**We build less, but we build it bulletproof.**
